We must explicitly import them\n   if native_format == 'BigInteger':\n     element.requires_imports.append('java.math.BigInteger')\n   elif native_format == 'DateTime':\n     element.requires_imports.append('com.google.api.client.util.DateTime')\n\nHere's another example:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/google-apis-client-generator/source/browse/src/googleap\nis/codegen/java/default/templates/___package___/ApiClient.java.tmpl\n\ncopied below:\n\n{% if api.dataWrapper %}\nimport com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCContent;\nimport com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCParser;\n{% endif %}\n\n\nHere's what we did in the GData code generator that I found very effective: \nevery time you use a Java class you call \nuse(\"com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCContent\").  It automatically \ntracks all of the \"extraImports\" this way, and so you never have write any \nexplicit import statements in your templates.  If that section of generation \nisn't called, use() is never called.  So you don't need to duplicate your \nif-logic between the code section and the import section.  It also takes care \nof other logic like determining if there is a collision between two classes and \ntherefore decide when to use just the class name or a fully-qualified class \nname.\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `rmis...@google.com` on 27 Sep 2011 at 3:31"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/comments/76558893","html_url":"https://github.com/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/303#issuecomment-76558893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/303","id":76558893,"user":{"login":"GoogleCodeExporter","id":9614759,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9614759?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter","html_url":"https://github.com/GoogleCodeExporter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","updated_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","body":"```\nThis issue was reported internally by yanivi@google.com\n```\n\nOriginal comment by `rmis...@google.com` on 27 Sep 2011 at 5:42"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z"}

We must explicitly import them\n   if native_format == 'BigInteger':\n     element.requires_imports.append('java.math.BigInteger')\n   elif native_format == 'DateTime':\n     element.requires_imports.append('com.google.api.client.util.DateTime')\n\nHere's another example:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/google-apis-client-generator/source/browse/src/googleap\nis/codegen/java/default/templates/___package___/ApiClient.java.tmpl\n\ncopied below:\n\n{% if api.dataWrapper %}\nimport com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCContent;\nimport com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCParser;\n{% endif %}\n\n\nHere's what we did in the GData code generator that I found very effective: \nevery time you use a Java class you call \nuse(\"com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.JsonCContent\").  It automatically \ntracks all of the \"extraImports\" this way, and so you never have write any \nexplicit import statements in your templates.  If that section of generation \nisn't called, use() is never called.  So you don't need to duplicate your \nif-logic between the code section and the import section.  It also takes care \nof other logic like determining if there is a collision between two classes and \ntherefore decide when to use just the class name or a fully-qualified class \nname.\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `rmis...@google.com` on 27 Sep 2011 at 3:31"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/comments/76558898","html_url":"https://github.com/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/303#issuecomment-76558898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/303","id":76558898,"user":{"login":"GoogleCodeExporter","id":9614759,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9614759?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter","html_url":"https://github.com/GoogleCodeExporter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","updated_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","body":"\n\nOriginal comment by `yan...@google.com` on 7 Nov 2011 at 5:37\n* Added labels: **Priority-Low**\n* Removed labels: **Priority-Medium**"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z"}

But then I also want some kind of RemoteRequestInitializer interface \nthat works just like HttpRequestInitializer that allows any parameter in \nRemoteRequest to be initialized the same across all RemoteRequests.\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `rmis...@google.com` on 27 Sep 2011 at 3:48"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/comments/76558910","html_url":"https://github.com/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/305#issuecomment-76558910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/305","id":76558910,"user":{"login":"GoogleCodeExporter","id":9614759,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9614759?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter","html_url":"https://github.com/GoogleCodeExporter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:05Z","updated_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:05Z","body":"\n\nOriginal comment by `yan...@google.com` on 7 Nov 2011 at 5:36\n* Added labels: **Priority-High**\n* Removed labels: **Priority-Medium**"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:05Z"}

This has \nreturned results ok and displayed them in my Android app until about 9 days \nago. Now the query returns with a JSON result but the value for the \n'totalResults' field is of type string rather than number (i.e. it now returns \n\"185000\", but used to return 185000) and as a result an \nIllegalArgumentException is thrown when the JSON parser tries to convert the \n\"185000\" to the expected type of number. I checked the source code for \ngoogle-api-services-customsearch-v1-1.2.2-beta and in Query.java the \"private \nInteger totalResults\" field is marked with the annotation \n\"@Key(\"totalResults\")\" - see line 217.

It makes sense to have convenience Rake tasks, but I think tests should also be runnable directly with RSpec's command-line tool.\r\n\r\nMy `$RUBYOPT` doesn't contain anything, it's just that Rake was somehow required twice, so Ruby reports already initialized constants, which is a type of warning that is always outputted, regardless of `-w`. It just seems like there is something wrong going on. Don't you get these warnings? I use Ruby 2.2 and Rake 10.4.2."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:11Z"}

Read/Write users can upload and pull images and our read-only user ``docker`` can pull and not push.\r\n\r\nHowever, if someone does try a push operation authenticated as the ``docker`` user then the push command suddenly exists with an error code of 1.\r\n\r\n    $ sudo docker push docker.aws.42lines.net/jjneely/testing:latest\r\n    The push refers to a repository [docker.aws.42lines.net/jjneely/testing] (len: 1)\r\n    Sending image list\r\n    2014/08/27 10:51:11 $\r\n\r\nRunning the docker daemon in debug mode it clearly reports a 401 error from the server, but this never makes its way to a useful error message for the client.  It would be great if the client would handle this with an appropriate error message."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/docker/issues/comments/76558922","html_url":"https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/7761#issuecomment-76558922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/docker/issues/7761","id":76558922,"user":{"login":"thaJeztah","id":1804568,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1804568?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah","html_url":"https://github.com/thaJeztah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:10Z","updated_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:10Z","body":"related / dup of https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/11016?"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:11Z","org":{"id":5429470,"login":"docker","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/docker","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5429470?"}}

The idea is that `^` is \"not\", and then `` `(    )`` is \"tilde and at least four spaces\" (again, supposed to be exactly 4 spaces in the parens), so the two common ways of starting code blocks.

references, such as a standards document, or specification?\n\nn/a\n\nJava environments (e.g. Java 6, Android 2.3, App Engine, or All)?\n\nAll, but particularly relevant for low-memory devices like Android\n\nPlease describe the feature requested.\n\nWe need an ability in the generated service-specific libraries to parse a feed \nof entries as a stream, without having to load the whole feed into memory which \nmay cause an OutOfMemoryError on low-memory devices.\n\nHere is a code snippet that Alon Albert wrote that demonstrates one possible \nway this can be accomplished today:\n\n          while (true) {\n                final JsonParser parser = JsonHttpParser.parserForResponse(jsonFactory, response);\n                parser.nextToken();\n                JsonToken token = parser.getCurrentToken();\n                String nextPageToken = null;\n                while (token == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n                    String key = parser.getText();\n                    parser.nextToken();\n                    if (key.equals(\"nextPageToken\")) {\n                        nextPageToken = parser.parse(String.class, null);\n                    } else if (key.equals(\"items\")) {\n                        while (true) {\n                            // skip START_ARRAY/END_OBJECT\n                            parser.nextToken();\n                            if (parser.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.END_ARRAY) {\n                                break;\n                            }\n                            final Entry entry = parser.parse(Entry.class, null);\n                            System.out.println(entry);\n                        }\n                    } else {\n\n                        parser.skipChildren();\n                    }\n                    token = parser.nextToken();\n                }\n                if (nextPageToken == null) {\n                    break;\n                }\n                response = builder.setPageToken(nextPageToken).executeUnparsed();\n            }\n\nIdeally we would add support that would support the that Alon needs here, but \nthat wouldn't require him to write any JsonParser low-level parsing code.\n\nI tried to implement something like this long ago with JsonFeedParser:\n\nhttp://javadoc.google-api-java-client.googlecode.com/hg/1.5.1-beta/com/google/ap\ni/client/googleapis/json/JsonFeedParser.html\n\nbut for various reasons that doesn't do what we want.  So either we fix up \nJsonFeedParser to work better, or try a different approach.  For example, we \ncould try Iterator<Entry> for accessing the entries, though keep in mind we \nstill need the ability the ability to parse the feed metadata.\n\nFinally, we need to integrate this into the generated service-specific \nlibraries, so this is easy to use and discover.\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `yan...@google.com` on 28 Oct 2011 at 8:16"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/comments/76559010","html_url":"https://github.com/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/333#issuecomment-76559010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/333","id":76559010,"user":{"login":"GoogleCodeExporter","id":9614759,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9614759?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter","html_url":"https://github.com/GoogleCodeExporter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:50Z","updated_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:50Z","body":"\n\nOriginal comment by `yan...@google.com` on 19 Jan 2013 at 8:16\n* Added labels: **Milestone-Version2.1.0**\n* Removed labels: **Milestone-Version2.0.0**"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:50Z"}

references, such as a standards document, or specification?\n\nn/a\n\nJava environments (e.g. Java 6, Android 2.3, App Engine, or All)?\n\nAll, but particularly relevant for low-memory devices like Android\n\nPlease describe the feature requested.\n\nWe need an ability in the generated service-specific libraries to parse a feed \nof entries as a stream, without having to load the whole feed into memory which \nmay cause an OutOfMemoryError on low-memory devices.\n\nHere is a code snippet that Alon Albert wrote that demonstrates one possible \nway this can be accomplished today:\n\n          while (true) {\n                final JsonParser parser = JsonHttpParser.parserForResponse(jsonFactory, response);\n                parser.nextToken();\n                JsonToken token = parser.getCurrentToken();\n                String nextPageToken = null;\n                while (token == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n                    String key = parser.getText();\n                    parser.nextToken();\n                    if (key.equals(\"nextPageToken\")) {\n                        nextPageToken = parser.parse(String.class, null);\n                    } else if (key.equals(\"items\")) {\n                        while (true) {\n                            // skip START_ARRAY/END_OBJECT\n                            parser.nextToken();\n                            if (parser.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.END_ARRAY) {\n                                break;\n                            }\n                            final Entry entry = parser.parse(Entry.class, null);\n                            System.out.println(entry);\n                        }\n                    } else {\n\n                        parser.skipChildren();\n                    }\n                    token = parser.nextToken();\n                }\n                if (nextPageToken == null) {\n                    break;\n                }\n                response = builder.setPageToken(nextPageToken).executeUnparsed();\n            }\n\nIdeally we would add support that would support the that Alon needs here, but \nthat wouldn't require him to write any JsonParser low-level parsing code.\n\nI tried to implement something like this long ago with JsonFeedParser:\n\nhttp://javadoc.google-api-java-client.googlecode.com/hg/1.5.1-beta/com/google/ap\ni/client/googleapis/json/JsonFeedParser.html\n\nbut for various reasons that doesn't do what we want.  So either we fix up \nJsonFeedParser to work better, or try a different approach.  For example, we \ncould try Iterator<Entry> for accessing the entries, though keep in mind we \nstill need the ability the ability to parse the feed metadata.\n\nFinally, we need to integrate this into the generated service-specific \nlibraries, so this is easy to use and discover.\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `yan...@google.com` on 28 Oct 2011 at 8:16"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/comments/76559012","html_url":"https://github.com/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/333#issuecomment-76559012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrsmith/google-api-java-client/issues/333","id":76559012,"user":{"login":"GoogleCodeExporter","id":9614759,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9614759?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter","html_url":"https://github.com/GoogleCodeExporter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoogleCodeExporter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:50Z","updated_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:50Z","body":"\n\nOriginal comment by `yan...@google.com` on 7 Feb 2013 at 12:05\n* Added labels: **Milestone-Version1.16.0**\n* Removed labels: **Milestone-Version2.1.0**"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-03-01T00:00:50Z"}

I huge help for the community to try and get away from being forced into using Angular when using AppGyver.\r\n\r\nWe are planning to use Aurelia.io instead of BackBone. I'm very interested in some general guidelines for how to port your approach to using something else.\r\n\r\nWhat is the starting point of the app and do you hook up the essential infrastructure to be compatible with AppGyver steroids?\r\n\r\nI see that your App object in `Index.js` is a Backbone Controller.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nvar App = Backbone.Controller.extend({`\r\n  initialize:  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin Aurelia you would usually have the Router instead\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {Router} from 'aurelia-router';\r\n\r\nexport class App {\r\n  static inject() { return [Router]; }\r\n  constructor(router) {\r\n    this.router = router;\r\n    this.router.configure(config => {\r\n      ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I guess for AppGyver you don't use routing as every page is its own miniapp?\r\n\r\nThen in the initializer you call various other initializers such as `self._initPages();` which creates all pages, by creating instance of page then calling `initializePage()`.\r\nSo here a supersonic ui view is created stored in `self.m_page`. \r\nIs this a specific to supersonic or just your own convention?\r\n\r\n```\r\n    var PageView = Backbone.View.extend({\r\n\r\n        /**\r\n         Create the Steroids page / view identity\r\n         @method initializePage\r\n         **/\r\n        initializePage: function () {\r\n            var self = this;\r\n            self.m_page = new supersonic.ui.View({\r\n                location: self.location,\r\n                id: self.pageID\r\n            });\r\n            self.m_page.start();\r\n            if (self.options && self.options.init == false)\r\n                return self;\r\n            self._initialize();\r\n            return self;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could ask so many more questions about this whole architecture... Would be awesome if you could write up a blog post explaining the main design considerations. Thanks!
